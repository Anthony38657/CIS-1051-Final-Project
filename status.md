Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

As of now, I have focused on coding the core logic of the Renju game, ensuring that the fundamental rules and mechanics are accurately represented in Python. This includes the rules governing the placement of pieces, win conditions, and any other essential gameplay elements. Additionally, I have begun the process of integrating Pygame into the project to lay the foundation for the graphical and interactive aspects of the game. This involves setting up the game window, handling user input, and working on the initial rendering of game elements.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Moving forward, my plan is to continue refining the game logic as needed, ensuring its accuracy and completeness. Simultaneously, I will deepen my understanding of Pygame to effectively implement features such as displaying the game board, handling player input for moves, and updating the interface based on the game state. Regular testing will be essential to identify and address any issues that may arise during the integration of Pygame, and I will also seek to improve the user experience by implementing clear and intuitive visuals.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
