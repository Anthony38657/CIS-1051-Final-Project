# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Renju game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Renju game coded in Python that provides a digital platform for two players to strategically compete by placing stones on a grid, aiming to achieve a winning pattern of five stones in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My Renju game project in Python aims to create a digital version of the classic strategy board game, Renju. The code will allow two players to take turns placing their stones on a grid with the objective of forming a continuous line of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game will feature a user-friendly interface, enabling players to make moves by selecting grid positions. It will incorporate game logic to validate and enforce the rules of Renju, such as checking for winning conditions. To execute the project, I can utilize a graphical user interface (GUI) library in Python, such as Pygame, to create the game board and handle user input. The core game logic would involve tracking the positions of stones, checking for win conditions, and managing the turn-based nature of the game. Once completed, players can engage in strategic battles of Renju, enhancing their gaming experience with a digital rendition of this classic board game.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Implement the game logic for Renju in Python.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Implement the game logic for Renju, create a functional display of the game, and design a user interface for a more engaging player experience.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Implement the game logic for Renju, create a visually appealing and intuitive user interface, display the game seamlessly, and incorporate a feature that prompts players to decide whether to replay the game or not after completion.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

To proceed with the Renju game project, my next steps involve acquiring knowledge in Pygame, a popular Python library for game development. I'll need to delve into the documentation and tutorials for Pygame to understand its functionalities and how to implement game graphics and user interfaces. This will include learning how to create and manage game windows, handle user input, and render game elements. Additionally, I may need to explore concepts related to GUI design to ensure a visually appealing interface for the players. Since I'm not working with any classmates, I'll be responsible for all aspects of the project, from game logic implementation to the integration of Pygame for the graphical and interactive components.
